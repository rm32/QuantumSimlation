A simulation of a quantum computer was implemented on a classical computer using the Java programming language. All basic components of a quantum computer were created and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Grover's quantum search algorithm and Shor's integer factorisation algorithm were implemented and successfully run. Shor's algorithm was used to factor 15 and 21 into their primes using a personal computer.
