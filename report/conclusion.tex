All components of a quantum computer have been successfully implemented in a Java simulation. With three working algorithms and a framework for extensions, the concept of quantum computing has been shown viable. We correctly implemented Deutsch-Jozsa, Grover's and Shor's algorithms. Using Shor's algorithm, 15 and 21 were factored effectively. By implementing operators in several different ways, performance and general memory usage have been improved throughout development.
